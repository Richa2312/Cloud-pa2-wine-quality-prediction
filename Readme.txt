Programming Assignment 2 - Wine Quality Prediction
Name: Richa Shrivastava
UCID: rs2353

Description:

The purpose of this individual project is to learn how to develop parallel machine learning (ML)
applications in Amazon AWS cloud platform. Specifically,you will learn:(1) how to use Apache Spark to train an ML model in parallel on multiple EC2 instances;
(2) how to use Sparkâ€™s MLlib to develop and use an ML model in the cloud;
(3) How to use Docker to create a container for your ML model to simplify model deployment.
You have to build a wine quality prediction ML model in Spark over AWS. The model must
be trained in parallel on multiple EC2 instances. Then, you need to save and load the model in an application
that will perform wine quality prediction; this application will run on one EC2 instance. The project
must be implemented in Java, Scala, or Python on Ubuntu Linux. The details of the assignment are
presented below:

Step by Step Installation process and commands for setup on cloud:

** Update master & check python versions:
  sudo yum update -y
  python --version
  sudo nano /etc/sudoers
  /*find below line with  Defaults    secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
   Just add /usr/local/bin to this PATH */

** Install findspark and upgrade pip:
	sudo pip install --upgrade pip
	sudo pip install findspark
	sudo pip install pyspark
	sudo pip install prettytable

** Run the training program:
	python train.py 

** Run the Test program for prediction: (Add TestDataset before run this program)
	python test.py

** Docker Installation and Run the program:
	sudo yum install -y docker
	sudo service docker start
	sudo docker build . -t richashrivastava/winequalityprediction
	sudo docker run richashrivastavae/winequalityprediction

** Please find below set of commands for installation errors and checks:
	sudo pip install --upgrade pip
	sudo pip install findspark
	sudo pip install prettytable
	sudo pip install numpy
	sudo docker rmi -f  image image_name
	sudo  docker images
	sudo docker run image_tag_name
	sudo docker build . -t username/image_tag_name
	sudo docker run username/image_tag_name
	sudo docker start container_name
	sudo docker stop container_name
	sudo docker login -u richashrivastava
